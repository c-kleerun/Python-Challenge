# Python-Challenge
Python code written to complete a challenge to analyze financial records for a company. The script analyzes the given records to calculate:
  * The total number of months included in the dataset
  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
  * Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes
  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

When run, the script writes the information to a .txt file, named "financial_analysis." It can be found in the PyBank/Analysis folder in this repo.

This challenge also has code to help determine vote counts for a small, rural town. The script analyzes the data to calculate:
  * The total number of votes cast
  * A complete list of candidates who received votes
  * The percentage of votes each candidate won
  * The total number of votes each candidate won
  * The winner of the election based on popular vote.

When run, this script writes the information to a .txt file, named "election_results." It can be found in the PyPoll/Analysis folder in this repo.
